The project I was assigned was to assist the company DriverPass in creating their online driver's education program. The client wanted a system that allowed users to sign up for different tiered memberships where they could take online courses, in person driving lessons, and practice exams. The purpose of the program is to prepare the user for their driver's  license test.

I think I did a good job of sticking to the clients requests and not going out of their desired range. I did this by only following the exact vocabulary that the client provided me with in order to stay as close to their desires as possible.

I Think I would improve my vocabulary to make the document more professional and descriptive.

I interpreted the user's needs through notes from an interview with members of my team and the client. By strictly folllowing these notes I was able to capture the clients needs with immense percision.

You have to design a software in steps. First you need to understand the purpose of the software, what is the end goal? Next you need to plan it out, for example by making a pseudocode or diagram. Lastly you program it while periodically testing the program to ensure that it is of quality.
